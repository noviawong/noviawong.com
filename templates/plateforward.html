        <h2>Problem Scoping</h2>
        <p>The first day my team and I met with Top Box Foods, we sat down and discussed about Plate Forward. We learned about Top Box Foods’ missions and goals</p>
        <p class="description-text">Top Box Foods is a nonprofit organization who partners with local farmers to provide affordable organic food items to low-income families in the Chicago area. They had approximately 5-10 full-time employees working at the office every day, and the rest of the staff were volunteers. We also learned that Plate Forward was a new initiative that Top Box Foods was starting. The goal of Plate Forward is to create a “buy one give one” model, involving both low-income areas as well as areas with more affluent individuals; the concept is when affluent individuals purchase a box of organic food, low-income families would receive discounts on the same box when they make a purchase.</p>

        <p>After familiarizing ourselves with Top Box Foods and Plate Forward, my team and I began to set expectations and narrowed down our problem scope. Keeping the time constraint in mind, we and Top Box Foods agreed to focus our efforts on designing and creating a functioning e-commerce website for Plate Forward. To guide the rest of our design process, we focused on the following questions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How can Plate Forward convey information to both affluent individuals and low-income families?</li>
            <li>How can Top Box Foods motivate affluent individuals to participate in Plate Forward?</li>
            <li>How can Plate Forward provide feedback to its members? More particularly, how can Top Box Foods help track the progress they have made through Plate Forward?</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="max">
        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <p> As soon as we decided that we were building a website, we listed several action items for the entire team. Among the action items, one was to create the information architecture for the website before we even brainstorm different designs for the site. Ideally, Plate Forward would be a subscription based service, which means members could set up auto-payment for the same boxes of food they would like to receive each month. Keeping the business goal in mind, we examined websites that had similar subscription based services, both in the same domain (i.e., food industry and nonprofit) and different domains. Examples of websites that we looked at include: Imperfect Produce <a href="https://www.imperfectproduce.com/">(https://imperfectproduce.com)</a> and Tom Shoes’ One for One <a href="https://www.toms.com/one-for-one-en/">(https://www.toms.com/one-for-one-en/)</a>.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="img60" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='PlateForward_IA.png') }}" alt="Example of original information architecture for the Plate Forward website. It includes a lot of crossed out sections and it's a bit unorganized.">
            <p class="caption">Original brainstorming of potential information architecture for the Plate Forward website.</p>
        </figure>
            <p>We worked as a team to create an information architecture that we were comfortable with, and then we presented the structure to our stakeholders. During the discussion, our stakeholder expressed concerns for some of our initial ordering. For example, they believed that “Recipes” did not need to have its own tab on the navigation menu. For some of the functions we believed were essential, we justified our decisions and made compromises, such as instead of completely eliminating the search bar, we decided to approach it when we had time instead of placing it as one of our main focuses. Finally, after we and our stakeholders reached an agreement, we proceeded to our next step, brainstorming and ideation.</p>

        <hr class="max">
        <h2>Brainstorming and Ideation</h2>
        <p>Following Google’s Spring Model, my team and I each sketched out how we imagined the website would look like. Guided by the information architecture we created, we spent approximately 30 minutes of sketching out different style of screens that contained the essential functions and features as indicated in our information architecture. Afterwards, my team didn’t take long to come to an agreement on how we wanted the website to look like.</p>

            <br class="clear">

        <p>Now that we had a specific design in mind, we started assessing different e-commerce website builders, including Squarespace, Wix, and even plain HTML/CSS codes. We listed our current design as one of the constraints when evaluating which e-commerce tool to use, because we believed that we should not limit the way we design simply based on limitation of a web building tool. As a result, we took an approach where we first explored all design solutions available, then adjusted and tweaked our designs based on what our final tool could do. We evaluated each tool based on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cost</b>: given that Top Box Foods is a non-profit organization, the tool has to be low cost.</li>
            <li><b>E-commerce</b>: Plate Forward involves monetary exchanges, which means e-commerce functionality is a must.</li>
            <li><b>Learning curve</b>: the tool must be easy to use for non-coders, since Top Box Foods runs on a volunteer basis and doesn’t have many coders.</li>
            <li><b>Design freedom</b>: the tool must be able to support custom coding and changes in design. Templates may be used, but should allow for users’ freedom in designing a site they want.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the end, only one tool fit the majority of these criteria: Squarespace. After choosing Squarespace as our tool, we decided to fully sketch out each screen before building the website directly on Squarespace. My team and I also had a discussion about whether a click-through prototype was necessary prior to directly implementing the design on Squarespace. Due to time constraint, we deemed it as unnecessary and decided to substitute that with paper prototype/sketches.</p>

        <hr class="max">
       <h2>Implementation and Prototyping: Squarespace</h2>
       <p>To implement the design on Squarespace, we created an account on Squarespace and learned to use Squarespace on our own. We each spent some time to explore Squarespace on our own before coming back together to discuss each person’s role.<br><br>Given that there were 4 of us, we split up the tasks during the implementation and prototyping phase. While 2 of us focused on making changes and actually building the website on Squarespace, the other two focused on finding assets for the website (e.g., stock images) and developing user testing protocol. Knowing that we were on a time crunch and we still wanted to test out our design, we all agreed to conduct hallway usability testing with at least 5 users.<br><br>That being said, I was responsible for developing the user testing protocol for our next phase in the project.</p>

        <hr class="max">
       <h2>Usability Testing: with 9 different users</h2>
       <p>Together, we conducted 30-45 minutes usability testing with 9 different potential users. We each tested with at least 2 users, being the primary moderator. We ensured that each usability testing session had at least 1 moderator and 1 note taker. Ideally, we would like to test the design with people who were not familiar with Top Box Foods as an organization. However, due to time constraint, we were not able to obtain our most ideal users, and we could only test the design with users obtained from convenience samples -- all users were either friends or spouses of employees at Top Box Foods who had affluent statues in the immediate areas. Some testing sessions were conducted remotely through Skype and Hangout, while some were conducted in-person. We tested the following 3 tasks with all 9 users.</p>
       <figure>
           <img class="img70" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='PlateForwardProtocol.png') }}" alt="Image shows tasks for usability testing.">
       </figure>
       <p>After hours of usability testing, we were exhausted. But, we were able to find the following issues with our design through our user testing:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>In general, users preferred to have more explanation on how Plate Forward works as a subscription based service.</li>
           <li>The page “Shop Boxes” doesn’t have enough information for users to understand what a “box” means or how the process works.</li>
            <li>In addition to “Shop Now” and “Get Started”, there should be another call for action for volunteers.</li>
           <li>Another tab on the navigation menu may be necessary for opportunities, which include volunteering opportunities, donation opportunities, local farm tours, etc.</li>
           <li>There should always be a “Contact Us” button, not just at the footer.</li>
           <li>Users would appreciate it if they received more information and explanation on the naming of the initiative (i.e., Plate Forward) on the screen “Why Plate Forward”.</li>
           <li>When there is a picture of a local farm, users expected the pictures to be clickable and linked directly to the farms’ websites.</li>
       </ul>

      <hr class="max">
      <h2>Revision and Documentation</h2>
      <p>Based on the user testing results and our stakeholders’ feedback, we revised our design. For example, we created a new screen for “Opportunities” that specifically talks about volunteering, donation, and farm tour opportunities members and non-members may get through Plate Forward.<br><br>We spent our last day at Top Box Foods primarily revising and refining the website and creating documentations for Top Box Foods that would make the project sustainable. We did two things to ensure sustainability: (1) a 30 page report with HTML/CSS examples documenting some essential functions that we didn’t have time to implement, (2) a video tutorial on Squarespace.<br><br>While the entire team wrote the report together, I came up with the idea of a video tutorial and recorded the video myself. I believed that a video tutorial would help Top Box Foods to become more familiar with Squarespace and how they could potentially use Squarespace’s e-commerce function to support Plate Forward’s initiative.<br><br>This project ended with a presentation to our stakeholders, including the founders of Top Box Foods.<br><br>Finally, below is a full demo video of the Plate Forward website we implemented:</p>
