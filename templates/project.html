                <p><b>Summary</b> </br>Something Blue Consulting was a team-based course project. We were given three months
                    to work on this project with a client. Our client approached us with a desire to update and increase their social media usage.
                    After coducting six different contextual inquiries, my team and I organized the interview findings and our background research
                    information, we put together an affinity wall. Through this analysis, we further identified additional issues that the organization was facing and brainstormed solutions
                    around these newly identified issues. In the end, we suggested two solutions, one being the most practical and another being
                    the ideal solution for the orgnaization. Given the nature of the organization, both solutions consisted of minimal technology
                    usage, and instead focused on changing the way information was communicated between our client and another organization on campus.</p>

                <p><b>Summary:</b> RHCA stands for River House Condominium Association. To get messages across to residents, the Association currently
                    relies on paper notice that they put up on the glass windows at each building. This method requires the owners and residents to be
                    physically present at the building to receive new information, which is not always possible to do so (e.g., traveling).
                    The current non-centralized communication method presents a problem: a lack of available information for all house owners and
                    tenants, particularly, it lacks an effective, clean, and accessible information system for all. To address the need of portable
                    searching and communication, I created a prototype for a mobile application that facilitates efficient and comprehensive
                    searches for neighborhood information for all resident and owners at RHCA. The information users can find in this application
                    includes the following: neighborhood files  (e.g., board minutes, map, policies), neighborhood events, announcements, safety
                    alerts, chats and messages from other users, and money transaction.</p>

                businesses regarding information on special events. Our goal is to identify problems in the current communication methods and find out
                users' preferences in receiving information and provding feedback.

                 <p><b>Summary:</b> MealSpace is a solution that engages the student community that is new to a university campus
                    by providing a physical space for students to cook together to encourage healthy eating. This space provides ingredients for
                    tailored recipes, along with step-by-step guidance for preparing the meal. Drawing inspiration from maker spaces across the nation,
                    MealSpace is conceptualized from studying student habits, responses, and working with the University of Michigan Health Services.
                    Research was done with students regarding the transition to a college environment from high school or a different country,
                    since the drastic change of setting can push students to not prioritize healthy eating. Using various methods such as surveys,
                    contextual inquiry, and diary studies, MealSpace was created. The technical intervention focuses on a website for registration of
                    cooking sessions and a tablet interface for recipes. The main focus of MealSpace resides in engaging students to create a meal
                    with each other.</p>

                <p><b>Summary:</b> Today, passwords are a commonly used strategy for protecting online accounts. These
                accounts may include sensitive personal information such as financial statements in a
                bank account, or may include nearly no identifying information such as that in a gaming
                application on a phone. Yet, to increase the security of such accounts, users are often
                required to create passwords that comply with strict criteria (e.g., a minimum of one
                upper case, one lower case, one special character, one number, and a minimum character
                length). Using a self-reported questionnaire, Shay et al. (2010) found that when users
                were required to create passwords under such strict requirements, they often reused old
                passwords with little or no modifications. Users also reported to be more likely to forget
                passwords created under such restrictions because of the uncommon combinations used
                for "high security" passwords. With a memory recall test and a self-reported
                questionnaire, this study investigated the effect of three different password composition
                requirements on users' recall of the passwords they generated, their general attitudes, self-predicted
                memorability, and perceived security for the requirements. Results indicated
                that actual memorability was not affected by the choice of password composition
                requirement, but participants perceived each requirement differently. This study also
                explored other areas of interest, such as password composition strategies.</p>

                 <p><b>Summary:</b> Cyber security is often thought to be a topic in the computer science field.
                    However, it involves more than just the codes and the framework; a secured network also requires
                    users to be aware of the security situation and to take action. A common example is when the system
                    alerts the users of firewall expiration through a popup notification. However, it is often difficult
                    to know whether these alerts are influential in users’ decision-making regarding cyber security. One
                    way to explore the extent they are influenced is to observe their behaviors when these alerts are presented
                    to them. By using tools such as virtual machines, researchers can perform a study without harming the host
                    system (the computer’s physical hard drive) while documenting users’ behaviors. These tools will also provide
                    a virtual environment that stimulates a real computer setup. Virtual machines can also help researchers to
                    understand more about how different factors (e.g., cost, time, cognitive capacity) affect users’ decisions
                    in making cyber security choices. While this presentation focuses on how virtual machine technology can support
                    research on human decision-making in cyber security, future studies can also utilize this technology to further
                    improve the functionality of technology by incorporating human physical needs and their psychological needs. </p>

                 <p><b>Summary:</b> This is an ongoing NSF funded research study at San Jose State University, which I participated
                    as a research assistant when I was an undergraduate student at the university. This study is led by Dr. David Schuster
                    and his lab: Virtual Environments, Cognition, & Training Research Laboratory (VECTR). The current research focuses
                    on developing solution for problems in the cyber security field through the perspective of human factors. The funded study
                    particularly focuses on cyber network defense professionals and the relationship between human decision making models and their
                    daily work. </p>
