                <p><b>Summary</b> </br>Something Blue Consulting was a team-based course project. We were given three months
                    to work on this project with a client. Our client approached us with a desire to update and increase their social media usage.
                    After coducting six different contextual inquiries, my team and I organized the interview findings and our background research
                    information, we put together an affinity wall. Through this analysis, we further identified additional issues that the organization was facing and brainstormed solutions
                    around these newly identified issues. In the end, we suggested two solutions, one being the most practical and another being
                    the ideal solution for the orgnaization. Given the nature of the organization, both solutions consisted of minimal technology
                    usage, and instead focused on changing the way information was communicated between our client and another organization on campus.</p>

                <p><b>Summary:</b> RHCA stands for River House Condominium Association. To get messages across to residents, the Association currently
                    relies on paper notice that they put up on the glass windows at each building. This method requires the owners and residents to be
                    physically present at the building to receive new information, which is not always possible to do so (e.g., traveling).
                    The current non-centralized communication method presents a problem: a lack of available information for all house owners and
                    tenants, particularly, it lacks an effective, clean, and accessible information system for all. To address the need of portable
                    searching and communication, I created a prototype for a mobile application that facilitates efficient and comprehensive
                    searches for neighborhood information for all resident and owners at RHCA. The information users can find in this application
                    includes the following: neighborhood files  (e.g., board minutes, map, policies), neighborhood events, announcements, safety
                    alerts, chats and messages from other users, and money transaction.</p>

                 <p><b>Summary:</b> The city of Ferndale has tasked us to improve the communication between the city and its residents and local
                businesses regarding information on special events. Our goal is to identify problems in the current communication methods and find out
                users' preferences in receiving information and provding feedback.
