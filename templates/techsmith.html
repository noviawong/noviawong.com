            <p><b>Summary:</b><br>Goal<br>Identify problem space and user needs for a new company initiative. Design and create clickable wireframes for a web-based application for this new project.<br><br>Process<br>Since the project was a new initiative, the project team was formed as I joined the team. Using the research results that I found by talking to users and comparative analysis, I first narrowed down the problem space and identified various user groups. I then created personas that represented each user group and used those to understand how different stakeholders felt about the direction of the project. The direction of this project was very vague for the majority of the time when I was at TechSmith. Fortunately, through weekly meetings with the project manager and the lead UX designer of the company, I identified user flow with the existing product and created a user flow for the new design. After I created my initial wireframe, I began my iteration phase; throughout the iteration phase, I tested the design with the stakeholders, the users, as well as other designers at the company. I revised my wireframe and presented a click-through mid-fidelity prototype to the senior leadership at the company.<br><br>Solution<br>The design I created was a result of user research and research on what other similar products. My work constantly led to valuable discussions about the project, and helped clarify questions and constraints the project had in cross-department meetings. By the end of the internship, my design was ready to be shown to the engineering department to create an interactive design draft.</p>

        <h2>Quick Reflection</h2>
        <p>On the third day of my internship, I was in a meeting where another designer’s wireframe for a project was immediately rejected because of a technical limitation — frustration, rejection, endless wire-framing, and a lot of roadblocks were what I thought I was going into when I first started my internship. My three months at TechSmith this summer turned out to be an unforgettable and extremely inspiring experience that involved both design and user research skills. My main project revolved around designing a system interface that would support TechSmith’s sales and business models; alongside my main project, I also had the chance to contribute to designing for other products at TechSmith. As I worked on various projects at TechSmith, I not only applied the skills and methodologies that I learned in my classes, but also explored and utilized new methods alongside other UX professionals at TechSmith. My internship provided me a hands-on learning environment: I was invited to other designers’ design studios where I practiced using storyboarding, empathy maps, and wire-framing to brainstorm solutions for other designers’ projects; I was part of the testing team to explore a new heuristic evaluation, PURE method, and I provided feedback that could potentially help improve and personalize the method for TechSmith UX team; and I had the chance to explore multiple UX design applications, such as Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD. Overall, I used more than 10 different user research methodologies, and then took the results to guide and support my final design decisions for my internship.</p>
        <p>Throughout my internship, I was treated as a TechSmith UX designer, not just an intern; among all things I’ve accomplished and learned at TechSmith, the most valuable moments that I had were design pairings and various cross-department meetings. Generally speaking, meeting are considered to be boring and dreading. Yet, being part of these meetings made me feel that my research data and designs were helping to make a change and progressing the projects onward for the company. By being the sole designer on my project and presenting the designs to multiple stakeholders, I learned that my wireframes not only act as the initial prototypes for an interface, but also act as an agent that guides discussions between different departments and senior leaderships. In additional to that, I finally understood that in the UX field, research and design happen simultaneously; we don’t stop researching because we started designing and creating wireframes. My internship started with user research, then defining problem space and refining problem statement. I then began my wireframes creation, while navigating through various constraints from the technical and business teams. When I finished with my drafts, I took the design to my stakeholders and users for testing, and revised my design based on their feedback. This is the UX process that I didn’t anticipate to learn, but developed overtime during my internship at TechSmith.</p>
        <p>This internship experience helped me to understand the responsibilities of both a UX designer and a UX researcher. Prior to this internship, I had always thought I leaned more towards UX researcher and would ever see myself as a UX designer. However, with the encouragement, guidance, and support from my mentors and co-workers, I now see the possibility to become a UX designer or a UX professional who is equipped with both research and design skills. Finally, on the note of mentor support and guidance, one extremely important lesson I’ve learned is to advocate for our users. This isn’t something new given that this is what I have been learning since day one of my graduate program. However, striking that balance between advocating for our users, meeting their needs, and incorporating various business decisions can be challenging. As a user experience professional, I am the one who can speak for the users based on my research and the one who can find that middle ground that makes (almost) everyone happy.</p>
