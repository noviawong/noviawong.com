            <p><b class="lightblue">Summary:</b><br><b>Goal</b><br>Identify problem space and user needs for a new company initiative. Design and create clickable wireframes for a web-based application for this new project.<br><br><b>Process</b><br>Since the project was a new initiative, the project team was formed as I joined the team. Using the research results that I found by talking to users and comparative analysis, I first narrowed down the problem space and identified various user groups. I then created personas that represented each user group and used those to understand how different stakeholders felt about the direction of the project. The direction of this project was very vague for the majority of the time when I was at TechSmith. Fortunately, through weekly meetings with the project manager and the lead UX designer of the company, I identified user flow with the existing product and created a user flow for the new design. After I created my initial wireframe, I began my iteration phase; throughout the iteration phase, I tested the design with the stakeholders, the users, as well as other designers at the company. I revised my wireframe and presented a click-through mid-fidelity prototype to the senior leadership at the company.<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>The design I created was a result of user research and research on what other similar products. My work constantly led to valuable discussions about the project, and helped clarify questions and constraints the project had in cross-department meetings. By the end of the internship, my design was ready to be shown to the engineering department to create an interactive design draft.</p>

After conducting contextual inquiry, diary studies, surveys, and talking to professionals, we soon found that grocery shopping was not the problem college students face in unhealthy eating. As a result, we looked at prior research with college students regarding their transition to a college environment from high school or a different country. We found that since the drastic change of setting often require a lot of students' time and mental capacity, this change can push students to not prioritize healthy eating over for example, making new friends. We further studied our users by talking to sophomores and juniors at universities, and by consulting with nutritionist at the University Health Service.<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>Drawing inspiration from maker spaces across the nation, MealSpace is a solution that engages the student community that is new to a university campus by providing a physical space for students to cook together to encourage healthy eating. This space provides ingredients for tailored recipes, along with step-by-step guidance for preparing the meal. The technical intervention focuses on a website for registration of cooking sessions and a tablet interface for recipes. The main focus of MealSpace resides in engaging students to create a meal with each other.</p>

My advisor and I agreed that an implicit memory test would be the most beneficial for my goal. As a result, I created an implicit memory test that was embedded in the survey I sent to my participants at San Jose State University. After 2 to 3 weeks of data collection, I used Excel and SPSS to analyze the survey data and looked at statistical differences that either supported or rejected my hypotheses. My final thesis went through several versions of iteration before passing through the thesis review committee.<br><br><b>Article Abstract</b><br>Today, passwords are a commonly used strategy for protecting online accounts. These
                accounts may include sensitive personal information such as financial statements in a
                bank account, or may include nearly no identifying information such as that in a gaming
                application on a phone. Yet, to increase the security of such accounts, users are often
                required to create passwords that comply with strict criteria (e.g., a minimum of one
                upper case, one lower case, one special character, one number, and a minimum character
                length). Using a self-reported questionnaire, Shay et al. (2010) found that when users
                were required to create passwords under such strict requirements, they often reused old
                passwords with little or no modifications. Users also reported to be more likely to forget
                passwords created under such restrictions because of the uncommon combinations used
                for "high security" passwords. With a memory recall test and a self-reported
                questionnaire, this study investigated the effect of three different password composition
                requirements on users' recall of the passwords they generated, their general attitudes, self-predicted
                memorability, and perceived security for the requirements. Results indicated
                that actual memorability was not affected by the choice of password composition
                requirement, but participants perceived each requirement differently. This study also
                explored other areas of interest, such as password composition strategies.</p>

                 <p><b>Summary:</b> Cyber security is often thought to be a topic in the computer science field.
                    However, it involves more than just the codes and the framework; a secured network also requires
                    users to be aware of the security situation and to take action. A common example is when the system
                    alerts the users of firewall expiration through a popup notification. However, it is often difficult
                    to know whether these alerts are influential in users’ decision-making regarding cyber security. One
                    way to explore the extent they are influenced is to observe their behaviors when these alerts are presented
                    to them. By using tools such as virtual machines, researchers can perform a study without harming the host
                    system (the computer’s physical hard drive) while documenting users’ behaviors. These tools will also provide
                    a virtual environment that stimulates a real computer setup. Virtual machines can also help researchers to
                    understand more about how different factors (e.g., cost, time, cognitive capacity) affect users’ decisions
                    in making cyber security choices. While this presentation focuses on how virtual machine technology can support
                    research on human decision-making in cyber security, future studies can also utilize this technology to further
                    improve the functionality of technology by incorporating human physical needs and their psychological needs. </p>

                <p><b class="lightblue">Summary:</b><br><b>Goal</b><br>In two weeks, design and create a digital prototype experience using either AR or VR technology for a specific problem space.<br><br><b>Process</b><br>Given that this was part of the class projects, we learned the UX principles behind designing good AR and VR applications, such as being considerate of users fatigue, limit motion and acceleration to avoid motion sickness, and the ethical concerns with AR/VR. Before even learning about what digital tools I could use to prototype the experiences, I first had to determine whether AR or VR would be a better technology to use for the particular problem space. Then, I sketched out user journey and made some quick sketches regarding the potential interfaces and interactions users would have. The next step was to explore tools that I could use to realize the digital experiences. After assessing different options and digital tools for both AR and VR, I then started loading 3D models and virtual elements onto the digital prototypes. Unfortunately, I could not validate the design with actual users, but I was able to receive feedback regarding the technical aspect of the projects as well as the UX considerations of the project.
                    <br><br><b>Solution</b><br>There were two projects that were the results of this course: a solution that aims to reduce test anxiety in students and test-takers by taking them to a virtual testing site, and a solution that aims to facilitate trying on different makeup looks before making a commitment into buying the products or finding the right tutorials for the “look” they are going for. Two different digital prototype experiences were the final deliverables of the projects.</p>

                    to work on this project with a client. Our client approached us with a desire to update and increase their social media usage.
                    After coducting six different contextual inquiries, my team and I organized the interview findings and our background research
                    information, we put together an affinity wall. Through this analysis, we further identified additional issues that the organization was facing and brainstormed solutions
                    around these newly identified issues. In the end, we suggested two solutions, one being the most practical and another being
                    the ideal solution for the orgnaization. Given the nature of the organization, both solutions consisted of minimal technology
                    usage, and instead focused on changing the way information was communicated between our client and another organization on campus.</p>

                <p><b class="lightblue">Summary:</b><br> RHCA stands for River House Condominium Association. To get messages across to residents, the Association currently
                    relies on paper notice that they put up on the glass windows at each building. This method requires the owners and residents to be
                    physically present at the building to receive new information, which is not always possible to do so (e.g., traveling).
                    The current non-centralized communication method presents a problem: a lack of available information for all house owners and
                    tenants, particularly, it lacks an effective, clean, and accessible information system for all. To address the need of portable
                    searching and communication, I created a prototype for a mobile application that facilitates efficient and comprehensive
                    searches for neighborhood information for all resident and owners at RHCA. The information users can find in this application
                    includes the following: neighborhood files  (e.g., board minutes, map, policies), neighborhood events, announcements, safety
                    alerts, chats and messages from other users, and money transaction.</p>
