            <p><b class="navyblue">Summary:</b><br><b>Goal</b><br>Identify problem space and user needs for a new company initiative. Design and create clickable wireframes for a web-based application for this new project.<br><br><b>Process</b><br>Since the project was a new initiative, the project team was formed as I joined the team. Using the research results that I found by talking to users and comparative analysis, I first narrowed down the problem space and identified various user groups. I then created personas that represented each user group and used those to understand how different stakeholders felt about the direction of the project. The direction of this project was very vague for the majority of the time when I was at TechSmith. Fortunately, through weekly meetings with the project manager and the lead UX designer of the company, I identified user flow with the existing product and created a user flow for the new design. After I created my initial wireframe, I began my iteration phase; throughout the iteration phase, I tested the design with the stakeholders, the users, as well as other designers at the company. I revised my wireframe and presented a click-through mid-fidelity prototype to the senior leadership at the company.<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>The design I created was a result of user research and research on what other similar products. My work constantly led to valuable discussions about the project, and helped clarify questions and constraints the project had in cross-department meetings. By the end of the internship, my design was ready to be shown to the engineering department to create an interactive design draft.</p>

                    <p><b class="navyblue">Summary:</b><br><b>Goal</b><br>Our goal for this project was to create a patient-friendly bariatric decision aid that would both educate and assist patients to understand their surgical options and their potential outcomes and risks of each option. A local health informatics company gave us this project on redesigning their web-based bariatric surgery outcomes calculator. At first, my team and I had the goal of simply redesigning the web-page to make it more user-friendly for the patients. But then, after our research, we decided on a new goal instead.<br><br><b>Process</b><br>Multiple research methodologies were either attempted or used to collect user experiences and preferences. First, we conducted stakeholder interviews and received a demonstration of the outcomes calculator. Then, we attempted to schedule interviews with physicians and bariatric patients. Our attempt in trying to recruit our primary users failed, largely because of the sensitivity of the topic. As a result, we took a different approach and focused on completing our competitive analysis and turned to literature reviews on patients’ decision making process, as well as existing user experience from former bariatric patients. I led the UX research effort in finding blog posts and news articles about bariatric patients’ experiences in making a decision regarding which surgical option to choose from. From there onward, I created a persona that fit the model, and the persona had guided the design and our presentation ever since. Once the research stage was completed, I led the design phase and mentored a junior UX designer to create wireframes and high fidelity click-through prototypes with Figma. My team and I validated with 8 different people using our high fidelity prototype, and we presented to our colleagues at University of Michigan, our client, and even the VP of Technology at Snapchat.
<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>We took statistical components from the original outcomes calculator and embedded them into a patient-facing online decision aid. Patients would be able to use this decision aid independently, while learning about potential surgical options. Several differences between the original calculator and our decision aid include: (1) decision aid spans across different web pages, easing patients into the process instead of the one-page calculator, (2) decision aid takes into account patients’ lifestyle choices and gives a more holistic view of each surgical option than the original calculator, (3) decision aid offers a general route or a personalized route, taking patient privacy and resistance into account, (4) decision aid presents surgery risks and outcomes in a more visual form compared to the statistical and number-driven calculator, and (5) there are more visual information and media to aid patients in understanding their options, risks, and outcomes.</p>

After conducting contextual inquiry, diary studies, surveys, and talking to professionals, we soon found that grocery shopping was not the problem college students face in unhealthy eating. As a result, we looked at prior research with college students regarding their transition to a college environment from high school or a different country. We found that since the drastic change of setting often require a lot of students' time and mental capacity, this change can push students to not prioritize healthy eating over for example, making new friends. We further studied our users by talking to sophomores and juniors at universities, and by consulting with nutritionist at the University Health Service.<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>Drawing inspiration from maker spaces across the nation, MealSpace is a solution that engages the student community that is new to a university campus by providing a physical space for students to cook together to encourage healthy eating. This space provides ingredients for tailored recipes, along with step-by-step guidance for preparing the meal. The technical intervention focuses on a website for registration of cooking sessions and a tablet interface for recipes. The main focus of MealSpace resides in engaging students to create a meal with each other.</p>

My advisor and I agreed that an implicit memory test would be the most beneficial for my goal. As a result, I created an implicit memory test that was embedded in the survey I sent to my participants at San Jose State University. After 2 to 3 weeks of data collection, I used Excel and SPSS to analyze the survey data and looked at statistical differences that either supported or rejected my hypotheses. My final thesis went through several versions of iteration before passing through the thesis review committee.<br><br><b>Article Abstract</b><br>Today, passwords are a commonly used strategy for protecting online accounts. These
                accounts may include sensitive personal information such as financial statements in a
                bank account, or may include nearly no identifying information such as that in a gaming
                application on a phone. Yet, to increase the security of such accounts, users are often
                required to create passwords that comply with strict criteria (e.g., a minimum of one
                upper case, one lower case, one special character, one number, and a minimum character
                length). Using a self-reported questionnaire, Shay et al. (2010) found that when users
                were required to create passwords under such strict requirements, they often reused old
                passwords with little or no modifications. Users also reported to be more likely to forget
                passwords created under such restrictions because of the uncommon combinations used
                for "high security" passwords. With a memory recall test and a self-reported
                questionnaire, this study investigated the effect of three different password composition
                requirements on users' recall of the passwords they generated, their general attitudes, self-predicted
                memorability, and perceived security for the requirements. Results indicated
                that actual memorability was not affected by the choice of password composition
                requirement, but participants perceived each requirement differently. This study also
                explored other areas of interest, such as password composition strategies.</p>

                 <p><b>Summary:</b> Cyber security is often thought to be a topic in the computer science field.
                    However, it involves more than just the codes and the framework; a secured network also requires
                    users to be aware of the security situation and to take action. A common example is when the system
                    alerts the users of firewall expiration through a popup notification. However, it is often difficult
                    to know whether these alerts are influential in users’ decision-making regarding cyber security. One
                    way to explore the extent they are influenced is to observe their behaviors when these alerts are presented
                    to them. By using tools such as virtual machines, researchers can perform a study without harming the host
                    system (the computer’s physical hard drive) while documenting users’ behaviors. These tools will also provide
                    a virtual environment that stimulates a real computer setup. Virtual machines can also help researchers to
                    understand more about how different factors (e.g., cost, time, cognitive capacity) affect users’ decisions
                    in making cyber security choices. While this presentation focuses on how virtual machine technology can support
                    research on human decision-making in cyber security, future studies can also utilize this technology to further
                    improve the functionality of technology by incorporating human physical needs and their psychological needs. </p>

                    <p><b class="navyblue">Summary:</b><br><b>Goal</b><br>Based on our observation and initial interviews with music school students and instructors, we found that college students (non-music major) and adult learners are more motivated to learn music than younger music students. As a result, we wanted to use technology to further improve their experiences in learning music, particularly piano. Our goal was to move past beyond a mobile application to something more physical and tangible, and use pervasive design methodologies to identify our users’ pain points and what they really needed.<br><br><b>Process</b><br>Prior to setting our goal, my team and I went through long hours of discussion of what domain to focus on. To finally settle on one specific area, we assessed our own abilities, expertise in the domain in question, along with existing solutions. Then, we utilized methods such as cultural probe to understand the users: adult piano learners We found that the main problems students face when they first learn piano are (1) unable to identify their own mistakes, and (2) lack of communication between instructor and students. We then proceeded to rapid prototyping and user enactment, where users helped us to validate and critique our designs. Finally, we prototyped our project using Arduino to further simulate the experience, and recorded a video to show the full experience of what our users could potentially have. Using both our physical prototype and video, we were able to validate our solution with piano instructors and students.<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>Our solution, PianoLink, is an interactive system that supplements piano instructors’ absence during a practice session. It is aimed to assist adult piano beginners to identify their own mistakes while playing, and track their progress in a measurable way. Also, it is equipped with an amazing rainbow pattern to encourage piano learners to keep practicing, along with a mobile application that allows them to share their progress with other people, including their instructors and friends. This strip also comes with lights that project directly onto the piano keys as well as a touchscreen control panel for additional controls and settings. With this solution, users will be able to identify their own mistakes with the help of 3 different modes: learning, practice, and free play mode, helping users to learn to play with gradually increasing difficulties.</p>

Before even learning about what digital tools I could use to prototype the experiences, I first had to determine whether AR or VR would be a better technology to use for the particular problem space. Then, I sketched out user journey and made some quick sketches regarding the potential interfaces and interactions users would have. The next step was to explore tools that I could use to realize the digital experiences. After assessing different options and digital tools for both AR and VR, I then started loading 3D models and virtual elements onto the digital prototypes. Unfortunately, I could not validate the design with actual users, but I was able to receive feedback regarding the technical aspect of the projects as well as the UX considerations of the project.<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>There were two projects that were the results of this course: a solution that aims to reduce test anxiety in students and test-takers by taking them to a virtual testing site, and a solution that aims to facilitate trying on different makeup looks before making a commitment into buying the products or finding the right tutorials for the “look” they are going for. Two different digital prototype experiences were the final deliverables of the projects.</p>

                    the ideal solution for the orgnaization. Given the nature of the organization, both solutions consisted of minimal technology
                    usage, and instead focused on changing the way information was communicated between our client and another organization on campus.</p>

                    physically present at the building to receive new information, which is not always possible to do so (e.g., traveling).
                    The current non-centralized communication method presents a problem: a lack of available information for all house owners and
                    tenants, particularly, it lacks an effective, clean, and accessible information system for all. To address the need of portable
                    searching and communication, I created a prototype for a mobile application that facilitates efficient and comprehensive
                    searches for neighborhood information for all resident and owners at RHCA. The information users can find in this application
                    includes the following: neighborhood files  (e.g., board minutes, map, policies), neighborhood events, announcements, safety
                    alerts, chats and messages from other users, and money transaction.</p>
