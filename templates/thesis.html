    <P class="projectcontent"><b>Summary:</b> Today, passwords are a commonly used strategy for protecting online accounts. These
accounts may include sensitive personal information such as financial statements in a
bank account, or may include nearly no identifying information such as that in a gaming
application on a phone. Yet, to increase the security of such accounts, users are often
required to create passwords that comply with strict criteria (e.g., a minimum of one
upper case, one lower case, one special character, one number, and a minimum character
length). Using a self-reported questionnaire, Shay et al. (2010) found that when users
were required to create passwords under such strict requirements, they often reused old
passwords with little or no modifications. Users also reported to be more likely to forget
passwords created under such restrictions because of the uncommon combinations used
for "high security" passwords. With a memory recall test and a self-reported
questionnaire, this study investigated the effect of three different password composition
requirements on users' recall of the passwords they generated, their general attitudes, self-predicted
memorability, and perceived security for the requirements. Results indicated
that actual memorability was not affected by the choice of password composition
requirement, but participants perceived each requirement differently. This study also
explored other areas of interest, such as password composition strategies.</P>
