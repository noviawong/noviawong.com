        <p><b>Summary:</b> MealSpace is a solution that engages the student community that is new to a university campus
            by providing a physical space for students to cook together to encourage healthy eating. This space provides ingredients for
            tailored recipes, along with step-by-step guidance for preparing the meal. Drawing inspiration from maker spaces across the nation,
            MealSpace is conceptualized from studying student habits, responses, and working with the University of Michigan Health Services.
            Research was done with students regarding the transition to a college environment from high school or a different country,
            since the drastic change of setting can push students to not prioritize healthy eating. Using various methods such as surveys,
            contextual inquiry, and diary studies, MealSpace was created. The technical intervention focuses on a website for registration of
            cooking sessions and a tablet interface for recipes. The main focus of MealSpace resides in engaging students to create a meal
            with each other.</p>

            The project goal was to create a socially engaging solution for a problem that a community current faces. To identify a community
            and the problem community members are facing, we brainstormed different population groups residing in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and
            categories of potential problems community members might face. We decided on the final three based on user group availability and
            group interest: (1) International college students' initial adjustment to foreign countries, (2) Teenagers and young adults'
            unhealthy amount of obsession with video games, and (3) College students and young adults' imbalanced eating habits. To choose a
            final community and problem to work on, we each conducted literature reviews and created mini-presentations among ourselves regarding
            the three topics. We also reached out to three professors at the University of Michigan and received input on the community we
            should work with.
            <br><br><font color="#004080"><b>Outcome</b>: Completing literature reviews and receiving outsiders' feedback on community
            selection allowed us to select a community group more objectively than simply relying on personal preferences. Literature
            reviews also revealed the past research conducted on the community as well as what solutions had been attempted in the past.</font>

            Initially, we thought the problem was poor meal planning. Therefore, to gauge more details about the challenges college
            students and young adults face when it comes to eating and grocery shopping, I developed a questionnaire that was sent to college
            students at University of Michigan. We decided to utilize an online questionnaire because we could <i><b>collect a large volume of data
            anonymously in a short period of time</b></i>, with just enough data that could move us forward to the next step in the process.
            Examples of questions asked in the survey include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>How often do you plan your meal?</li>
                <li>Are you concerned about the nutritional value of your meals?</li>
                <li>Are you currently using any online grocery shopping services?</li>
                <li>How often do you go grocery shopping?</li>
            </ul>
         <br><font color="#004080"><b>Outcome</b>: From this initial survey, we received over 30 responses and learned four major needs of our community:
            (1) access to healthy and affordable food, (2) guidelines on how to effectively prepare food, (3) nutritional information,
            and (4) convenience and time.</font>

        <p>
            With the user needs in mind, we put together a competitive analysis to assess what solutions have already been attempted specifically
            for meal planning and expedited grocery shopping. This chart also helped us to identify what aspects of the current solutions were
            flawed and what worked well.

            <b>2.</b> User Research </br></p>

            We quickly decided to design a mobile application to aid college students and young adults to plan and shop for more balanced
            meals. With that said, the next phase was to identify features that users would like to see in the application, as well as to
            collect more data on what service they currently use. We provided seven different factors for users to rank, from 1 being the
            most important and 7 being the least important. I suggested the team to use printed copies for this one instead of an online
            survey. Given the time constraint we had and the amount of data we needed to collect, <i><b>a 3-question paper survey allowed
            us to quickly distribute the questions and collect users' perspectives on mobile application that aims to plan their meals,
            shop for their grocery, and track their nutrition.</b></i>
            <br><br><font color="#004080"><b>Outcome</b>: We collected 21 responses over the course of a week, enabling us to identify two
            key features users wanted to include in the solution: (1) Able to provide nutrition information for users and motivate them
            to eat nutritiously, and (2) low cost.</font>
        </p>
        <div align="center">

            While the paper survey was able to provide us quantitative data on what users prefer, we wanted to look more into detailed
            users' daily routines in terms of meal planning and grocery shopping. As a result, we conducted semi-structure interviews with
            young adults and college students, focusing on exploring the food items they purchase and eat on a regular basis, as well as their current
            technological solutions to solve problems they face in regards to tracking nutrition. To follow up with the interviews, we
            sent out a diary study that tracked data for one week. Users recorded their meal planning for that week, the food items they
            had and where they got them from, and the mood of their meals.
            <br><br><font color="#004080"><b>Outcome</b>: Through semi-structure interviews and diary studies, we further identified several
            solutions that currently solve the problems of tracking nutrition and expedited grocery shopping experiences (e.g., MyFitnessPal).
            We also found that most users plan their meals on the night before or the day of the meal, often written down on something
            physical. It was revealed to us that users often deviate from their grocery list when shopping for grocery and consume food items
            based on their immediate availability and ease of preparation. Finally, we found that social engagement during a meal increases
            satisfaction with the meal.</font>

            After user research, we began to make sketches for our mobile application both on paper and whiteboard. We identified several
            key features and the basic groups of functions to be included in the application. We agreed that the application needed to include
            profile setup, dietary preferences, recipes, meal planning, and nutrition tracking. However, we soon realized this solution does
            not address the actual user needs we discovered in our user research. I particularly argued that we were simply recreating and
            combining what currently exist into a new mobile application, and we were not creating something new and beneficial for the
            community. As a result, we decided to rethink our design solution by using a brainstorming matrix, and settled on merging what
            was known as "Maker Space" in the engineering field and our original idea of having recipes on a mobile application.

            Based on this new design solution, we refocused our problem scope as I designed an additional questionnaire to be sent out to
            undergraduate students at the University. This time, we wanted to understand their experiences when they first went through the
            transition of cooking independently. This iteration briefly brought us back to phase two of the research process of user research,
            but I believed that it was necessary to understand the true experiences and struggles users had gone through.

            <b>4.</b> User Feedback </br><br>
            After finalizing on our design solution, we contacted a dietitian nutritionist at University of Michigan for a semi-structured
            interviews to discuss about our solution. The interview lasted about 30 minutes long and she received an explanation and a walkthrough
            of our solution. She also interacted with our protoytpes and we received feedback from her both on the conceptual and practical aspects
            of the solution. We also had other open-ended questions regarding nutrition and eating habits of college students who were transitioning
            from having someone else cook for them to having to cook on their own.
            <br><br><font color="#004080"><b>Outcome</b>: We received more insight on the new problem scope and was able to verify
            the practicality of our solution. The feedback we received was positive and we were referred to the Dining Service on campus
            for further development.</font>
            <br><br>
            We also had current college students providing us with feedback on the solution. They reviewed the prototypes and commented on
            features they liked and features they were concerned about. For example, some expressed concerns about safety and the overall
            monetary cost of attending a MealSpace session. As a result, we reached out to MBA students and identified a business plan.
            <br><br><font color="#004080"><b>Outcome</b>: Survey results confirmed our hypothesis that college students in transition to
            cooking independently often face challenges to eat nutritiously. This became one of the major factors that lead to consuming imbalanced
            meals.</font>
