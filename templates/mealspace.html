                    <p><b class="lightblue">Summary:</b><br><b>Goal</b><br>Design a solution to improve college students' eating habits, including motivating them to eat nutritiously and plan their meals better.<br><br><b>Process</b><br>My team and I focused on grocery shopping habits at first. After conducting contextual inquiry, diary studies, surveys, and talking to professionals, we soon found that grocery shopping was not the problem college students face in unhealthy eating. As a result, we looked at prior research with college students regarding their transition to a college environment from high school or a different country. We found that since the drastic change of setting often require a lot of students' time and mental capacity, this change can push students to not prioritize healthy eating over for example, making new friends. We further studied our users by talking to sophomores and juniors at universities, and by consulting with nutritionist at the University Health Service.<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>Drawing inspiration from maker spaces across the nation, MealSpace is a solution that engages the student community that is new to a university campus by providing a physical space for students to cook together to encourage healthy eating. This space provides ingredients for tailored recipes, along with step-by-step guidance for preparing the meal. The technical intervention focuses on a website for registration of cooking sessions and a tablet interface for recipes. The main focus of MealSpace resides in engaging students to create a meal with each other.</p>

            <h2> Identifying Problem Scope </h2>
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_problem.jpg') }}" alt="Image shows brainstorming session of developing problem statement.">
            <p>
                The project goal was to create a socially engaging solution for a problem that a community current faces. To identify a community
                and the problem community members are facing, we brainstormed different population groups residing in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and
                categories of potential problems community members might face. We decided on the final three based on user group availability and
                group interest: (1) International college students' initial adjustment to foreign countries, (2) Teenagers and young adults'
                unhealthy amount of obsession with video games, and (3) College students and young adults' imbalanced eating habits. To choose a
                final community and problem to work on, we each conducted literature reviews and created mini-presentations among ourselves regarding
                the three topics. We also reached out to three professors at the University of Michigan and received input on the community we
                should work with.</p>
                <br><br><p class="outcome">Outcome: Completing literature reviews and receiving outsiders' feedback on community
                selection allowed us to select a community group more objectively than simply relying on personal preferences. Literature
                reviews also revealed the past research conducted on the community as well as what solutions had been attempted in the past.</p>
                <br><br><p class="outcome">The winner? College students and young adults' imbalanced eating habits.</p>
            <br>
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_initialsurvey.jpg') }}" alt="Sample survey items.">
            <p>
                Initially, we thought the problem was poor meal planning. Therefore, to gauge more details about the challenges college
                students and young adults face when it comes to eating and grocery shopping, I developed a questionnaire that was sent to college
                students at University of Michigan. We decided to utilize an online questionnaire because we could <i><b>collect a large volume of data
                anonymously in a short period of time</b></i>, with just enough data that could move us forward to the next step in the process.
                Examples of questions asked in the survey include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How often do you plan your meal?</li>
                    <li>Are you concerned about the nutritional value of your meals?</li>
                    <li>Are you currently using any online grocery shopping services?</li>
                    <li>How often do you go grocery shopping?</li>
                </ul>
             <br><p class="outcome">Outcome: From this initial survey, we received over 30 responses and learned four major needs of our community:
                (1) access to healthy and affordable food, (2) guidelines on how to effectively prepare food, (3) nutritional information,
                and (4) convenience and time.</p>
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_competitiveanalysis.png') }}" alt="Matrix for competitive analysis.">
            <p>
                With the user needs in mind, we put together a competitive analysis to assess what solutions have already been attempted specifically
                for meal planning and expedited grocery shopping. This chart also helped us to identify what aspects of the current solutions were
                flawed and what worked well.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!--Beginning of second stage of research process-->
            <h2> User Research </h2>
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_papersurvey.png') }}" alt="Items from paper survey.">
            <p>
                We quickly decided to design a mobile application to aid college students and young adults to plan and shop for more balanced
                meals. With that said, the next phase was to identify features that users would like to see in the application, as well as to
                collect more data on what service they currently use. We provided seven different factors for users to rank, from 1 being the
                most important and 7 being the least important. I suggested the team to use printed copies for this one instead of an online
                survey. Given the time constraint we had and the amount of data we needed to collect, <i><b>a 3-question paper survey allowed
                us to quickly distribute the questions and collect users' perspectives on mobile application that aims to plan their meals,
                shop for their grocery, and track their nutrition.</b></i></p>
                <br><br><p class="outcome">Outcome: We collected 21 responses over the course of a week, enabling us to identify two
                key features users wanted to include in the solution: (1) Able to provide nutrition information for users and motivate them
                to eat nutritiously, and (2) low cost.</p>
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_diarystudies.png') }}" alt="Diary studies template.">
            <p>
                While the paper survey was able to provide us quantitative data on what users prefer, we wanted to look more into detailed
                users' daily routines in terms of meal planning and grocery shopping. As a result, we conducted semi-structure interviews with
                young adults and college students, focusing on exploring the food items they purchase and eat on a regular basis, as well as their current
                technological solutions to solve problems they face in regards to tracking nutrition. To follow up with the interviews, we
                sent out a diary study that tracked data for one week. Users recorded their meal planning for that week, the food items they
                had and where they got them from, and the mood of their meals.</p>
                <br><br><p class="outcome">Outcome: Through semi-structure interviews and diary studies, we further identified several
                solutions that currently solve the problems of tracking nutrition and expedited grocery shopping experiences (e.g., MyFitnessPal).
                We also found that most users plan their meals on the night before or the day of the meal, often written down on something
                physical. It was revealed to us that users often deviate from their grocery list when shopping for grocery and consume food items
                based on their immediate availability and ease of preparation. Finally, we found that social engagement during a meal increases
                satisfaction with the meal.</p>
            <!--Beginning of third stage of research process-->
            <br>
            <h2> Design and Prototype </h2>
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_firstsketch.png') }}" alt="Image of first sketches.">
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_initialsolution.jpg') }}" alt="Image shows sketches of first solutions.">
            <p>
                After user research, we began to make sketches for our mobile application both on paper and whiteboard. We identified several
                key features and the basic groups of functions to be included in the application. We agreed that the application needed to include
                profile setup, dietary preferences, recipes, meal planning, and nutrition tracking. However, we soon realized this solution does
                not address the actual user needs we discovered in our user research. I particularly argued that we were simply recreating and
                combining what currently exist into a new mobile application, and we were not creating something new and beneficial for the
                community. As a result, we decided to rethink our design solution by using a brainstorming matrix, and settled on merging what
                was known as "Maker Space" in the engineering field and our original idea of having recipes on a mobile application.
            </p>
            <img class="MealSpace_img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mealspace_final.jpg') }}" alt="Final solution">
            <br>
            <p>
                Based on this new design solution, we refocused our problem scope as I designed an additional questionnaire to be sent out to
                undergraduate students at the University. This time, we wanted to understand their experiences when they first went through the
                transition of cooking independently. This iteration briefly brought us back to phase two of the research process of user research,
                but I believed that it was necessary to understand the true experiences and struggles users had gone through.

                <p>Digital prototypes were created using Sketch, Invision, and Axure.</p>
            <!--Beginning of last stage of research process-->
            <br>
            <h2> User Feedback </h2>
                <p>After finalizing on our design solution, we contacted a dietitian nutritionist at University of Michigan for a semi-structured
                interviews to discuss about our solution. The interview lasted about 30 minutes long and she received an explanation and a walkthrough
                of our solution. She also interacted with our protoytpes and we received feedback from her both on the conceptual and practical aspects
                of the solution. We also had other open-ended questions regarding nutrition and eating habits of college students who were transitioning
                    from having someone else cook for them to having to cook on their own.</p>
                <br><br><p class="outcome">Outcome: We received more insight on the new problem scope and was able to verify
                the practicality of our solution. The feedback we received was positive and we were referred to the Dining Service on campus
                for further development.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>We also had current college students providing us with feedback on the solution. They reviewed the prototypes and commented on
                features they liked and features they were concerned about. For example, some expressed concerns about safety and the overall
                    monetary cost of attending a MealSpace session. As a result, we reached out to MBA students and identified a business plan.</p>
                <p>Our final deliverable was a poster presentation, a video demo of how MealSpace would work:</p><br>
