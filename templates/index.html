            I am a second year master student at University of Michigan School of Information, studying user experience research and design. My passion is deeply rooted in psychology and advancing technology for the vulnerable population. When I worked as a therapist, I realized the importance of user-friendly and accessible technology for therapists, parents, and children with special needs. So, I aim to improve the way we communicate and educate, particularly through accessible and intuitive technology. <br><br> I believe good design is supported by compelling research data. One way to get that data is through user research. Among the many different techniques, I particularly enjoy talking and observing people. By doing these two simple things, I can learn a lot both from and about them. And then, I can become a better advocate for them. <br><br> Besides UX, I also enjoy: playing the piano, baking, volunteering, and skeching characters and comic strips. I also love making new friends and learning something new everyday!
