                    <p><b class="navyblue">Summary:</b><br><b>Goal</b><br>Our goal for this project was to create a patient-friendly bariatric decision aid that would both educate and assist patients to understand their surgical options and their potential outcomes and risks of each option. A local health informatics company gave us this project on redesigning their web-based bariatric surgery outcomes calculator. At first, my team and I had the goal of simply redesigning the web-page to make it more user-friendly for the patients. But then, after our research, we decided on a new goal instead.<br><br><b>Process</b><br>Multiple research methodologies were either attempted or used to collect user experiences and preferences. First, we conducted stakeholder interviews and received a demonstration of the outcomes calculator. Then, we attempted to schedule interviews with physicians and bariatric patients. Our attempt in trying to recruit our primary users failed, largely because of the sensitivity of the topic. As a result, we took a different approach and focused on completing our competitive analysis and turned to literature reviews on patients’ decision making process, as well as existing user experience from former bariatric patients. I led the UX research effort in finding blog posts and news articles about bariatric patients’ experiences in making a decision regarding which surgical option to choose from. From there onward, I created a persona that fit the model, and the persona had guided the design and our presentation ever since. Once the research stage was completed, I led the design phase and mentored a junior UX designer to create wireframes and high fidelity click-through prototypes with Figma. My team and I validated with 8 different people using our high fidelity prototype, and we presented to our colleagues at University of Michigan, our client, and even the VP of Technology at Snapchat.
<br><br><b>Solution</b><br>We took statistical components from the original outcomes calculator and embedded them into a patient-facing online decision aid. Patients would be able to use this decision aid independently, while learning about potential surgical options. Several differences between the original calculator and our decision aid include: (1) decision aid spans across different web pages, easing patients into the process instead of the one-page calculator, (2) decision aid takes into account patients’ lifestyle choices and gives a more holistic view of each surgical option than the original calculator, (3) decision aid offers a general route or a personalized route, taking patient privacy and resistance into account, (4) decision aid presents surgery risks and outcomes in a more visual form compared to the statistical and number-driven calculator, and (5) there are more visual information and media to aid patients in understanding their options, risks, and outcomes.</p>
